## Analysis of Data

Pn_Ps <- read_tsv("PnPs_results.txt", col_types = "cfcddd")
view(Pn_Ps)
Dn_Ds <- read_tsv("DnDs_results.txt", col_types = "cfcddd")
view(Dn_Ds)
```
# Creating Boxplots
```
Pn_Ps %>% ggplot(aes(x = Histone, y = pn_ps, color = Ploidy)) + geom_boxplot()+ theme_classic() + ggtitle("Pn/Ps of Histone genes per Ploidy") + scale_color_manual(values = c("red","blue","yellow")) 
Dn_Ds %>% ggplot(aes(x = Histone, y = dn_ds, color = Ploidy)) + geom_boxplot()+ theme_classic() + ggtitle("Dn/Ds of Histone genes per Ploidy") + scale_color_manual(values = c("red","blue","yellow")) 
```
Since values did not change much between Pn/Ps and Dn/Ds and both graphs represent almost the exact some results, only Dn/Ds was use to create the second graph comparing sexual vs asexaul reproduction (instead of Ploidy)
```
dnds %>% ggplot(aes(x = Histone, y = dn_ds, color = Mode)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic() + scale_color_manual(values = c("blue","red")) + ggtitle("Dn/Ds between Sexual and Asexual lineages among Histone Genes")
```

# Stastical test 
only a statical test was ran on Dn/Ds results.
