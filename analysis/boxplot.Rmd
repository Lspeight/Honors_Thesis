## Analysis of Data

```{r plotting}
# load required libraries
library(tidyverse) # require() and library() achieve the same thing
```
# Import Data
```
Pn_Ps <- read_tsv("PnPs_results.txt", col_types = "cfcddd")
view(Pn_Ps)
Dn_Ds <- read_tsv("DnDs_results.txt", col_types = "cfcddd")
view(Dn_Ds)
```
# Creating Boxplots
```
Pn_Ps %>% ggplot(aes(x = Histone, y = pn_ps, color = Ploidy)) + geom_boxplot()+ theme_classic() + ggtitle("Pn/Ps of Histone genes per Ploidy") + scale_color_manual(values = c("red","blue","yellow")) 
Dn_Ds %>% ggplot(aes(x = Histone, y = dn_ds, color = Ploidy)) + geom_boxplot()+ theme_classic() + ggtitle("Dn/Ds of Histone genes per Ploidy") + scale_color_manual(values = c("red","blue","yellow")) 
```
Since values did not change much between Pn/Ps and Dn/Ds and both graphs represent almost the exact some results, only a statical test was ran on Dn/Ds results. 

# Stastical test
