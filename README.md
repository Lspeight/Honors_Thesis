# Selection Occuring on Repetivive Histone Genes
The overall hypothesis is that dN/dS values will give us insight into what selective pressures are being put on these genes, the functionality of them, and how they may be evolving differently in sexual and asexual snails.

## My Own Data
My data is in the form of Pileup FASTQ files. I have 27 lineages that include the sequences of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 genes
## Methods
Write a pythons code that is able to separate codons, identify changes, and statsitically acquire Dn/Ds values
## Results
My final results will be Dn/Ds values for each histone gene, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, found in each lineage..
