# Selection Occuring on Repetivive Histone Genes
The overall hypothesis is that evaluating synonymous and nonsynonmous changes occuring between repetive histone genes will give insight into what selective pressures are being put on these genes, the functionality of them, and how they may be evolving differently in sexual and asexual snails.

## My Own Data
My data has been generated with DeviaTE software. I have 26 lineages of *Potamopyrgus antipodarum*, and 1 out group, that include the sequences of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 genes
## Methods
Still being developed
## Results
To be determined
