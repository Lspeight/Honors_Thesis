# Asexual vs Sexual Reproductive Evolution and Selection Occuring on Repetivive Histone Genes
The lack of knowledge in functionality and location of these genes, raises the question as to if these genes are under any selective pressure and if that differs in snails of sexual vs asexual reproduction. This project focuses on the sequences of histone genes H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. A statistical approach is used to calculate the rate of substitutions at synonymous sites compared to the rate of substitutions at nonsynonymous sites between repetitive histone genes within a single individual that represents a lineage. The unknowns about these genes and how different modes reproduction may be affecting them could be comprehended by knowing what selective pressures are put on these genes. 


## Data
My data has been generated with DeviaTE software. I have 26 lineages of *Potamopyrgus antipodarum*, and 1 out group, that include the sequences of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 genes
## Methods
Still being developed
## Results
To be determined
