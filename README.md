# Asexual vs Sexual Reproductive Evolution and Selection Occuring on Repetivive Histone Genes
I hypothesize that accumulating histone genes in the genome of asexual *Potamopyrgus antipodarum* functional and would display a similar level of purifying selection as those of snails in sexual lineages. This must be proven against the null hypothesis that these asexual histone genes are under a weaker purifying selection or even positive selection, leading to the accumulation of deleterious mutations or nonsynonymous changes. This project focuses on the four sequences of histone genes: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. A statistical approach will be used to calculate nucleotide diversity, in the form of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes, between repetitive histone genes within a single individual that represents a lineage. 

## My Own Data
My data has been generated with DeviaTE software. I have 26 lineages of *Potamopyrgus antipodarum*, and 1 out group, that include the sequences of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 genes
## Methods
Still being developed
## Results
To be determined
